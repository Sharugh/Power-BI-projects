# Power-BI-projects

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of credit card defaults using Power BI. Leveraging the capabilities of Power BI, I employed DAX formulas to extract crucial insights from the dataset. One of the key aspects of my analysis was determining the total bill statement, enabling a clear understanding of the financial patterns within the dataset.

Additionally, I delved into the gender-based default ratios, employing DAX formulas to calculate and compare default occurrences between different genders. This analysis provided valuable insights into any potential gender-related trends or differences in default rates within the credit card data.

Through the visualization tools and DAX formula implementation within Power BI, I was able to create interactive and informative visual representations, allowing for a deeper understanding of credit card default patterns and gender-specific tendencies within the dataset.
